# RollerRun — Our Story (Cinematic) 💫

A tiny one-page web gift that scrolls through our memories with floating hearts and typewriter captions.  
No frameworks, no builds — just a single HTML file and some PNG images.

---

## What’s inside 📂
- index.html — the whole experience in one file
- Images placed in the same folder as index.html:
  - Backgrounds: beach.png, chiangmai.png, perth01.png, Perth02.png, victoryBG.png
  - Characters: clement.png, charles.png, ning.png, charlie.png, car.png

Tip: file names on the web are case-sensitive (Perth02.png is not the same as perth02.png).

---

## How to view it 🖥️📱
- Desktop/laptop: open index.html in any modern browser.
- Phone/tablet: save the whole folder to your device (Files app on iOS or local storage on Android), then open index.html in Safari/Chrome.
- You can also upload the same files to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, etc.) — no build step required.

## Make it yours ✍️
Open index.html and:
- Update the chapter texts to tell your story (they display with a typewriter effect).
- Choose which background each chapter uses (beach, chiangmai, perth1, perth2, victory).
- Pick which characters appear in each chapter (Clement, Ning, Charles, Charlie, Car).
- Want new art? Add a new PNG next to index.html and reference its exact filename in your chapter.

You’ll also find simple knobs for pacing (how long each chapter shows), scroll speed, parallax feel, heart frequency, and typing speed. Increase values for a faster vibe, decrease for slower, more cinematic moments.

## Image tips 🖼️
- Keep PNGs reasonably small for smooth performance on phones.
- Transparent backgrounds look best for characters.
- Keep everything next to index.html; avoid subfolders unless you also update the paths.

## If you want it online later 🌍
Upload index.html and all images to any static hosting service. Place the files at the site’s root and keep the same filenames. That’s it — no extra configuration.
